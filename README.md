This project contains samples for using the
[Google Wallet REST APIs](https://developers.google.com/wallet/) in the
following languages:

*   [Java](./java/README.md)
*   [C#](./dotnet/README.md)
*   [JavaScript (Node.js)](./nodejs/README.md)

*   Adding messages to a pass class
*   Creating, updating, and patching a pass object
*   Adding messages to a pass object
